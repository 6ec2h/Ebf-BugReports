To translate, simply look at addon_english, copypaste the tokens you wish to translate into the language of your choice.

For example, if you wish to translate Nyx's Burrow description, you find
"DOTA_Tooltip_ability_nyx_assassin_burrow_Description"					"Nyx Assassin buries himself beneath the battlefield over a short duration.\n\nOnce burrowed, Spiked Carapace instantly stuns nearby enemies when cast and its bonus armor is increased, the range of Mana Burn and Impale is increased, and Impale's cooldown is decreased.\n\nWhile burrowed, Nyx Assassin is stationary, has his attack range increased and gains magic resistance while restoring a percentage of his maximum health and mana."

Paste it into your language (addon_russian, for example) and translate.
"DOTA_Tooltip_ability_nyx_assassin_burrow_Description"					"Russian Words Here"
